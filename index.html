								The SDR is designed to provide demographic and career history information about science, engineering, and

								make planning decisions regarding science and engineering research, training, and employment opportunities.
								Employers also use the SDR to understand trends in employment sectors, industry types, and salary. Students who
								want to learn about the relationship between graduate education and careers often obtain valuable information
								from the SDR.<br><br>
								This study is the only comprehensive source of data on the careers of science, engineering, and health
								doctorate holders from U.S. academic institutions. It serves as an essential and irreplaceable resource on the
								training, work experience, and career development of a highly educated population.

								The SDR sample was randomly selected from the Doctorate Record File (DRF), a database containing the name and

								Sample members serve as representatives of the entire U.S.-trained doctoral population in the fields of
								science, engineering and health.<br>
								Upon completing your doctoral degree, you were asked to complete a Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED)
								questionnaire and this information was added to the DRF. From among those listed in the DRF up through academic
								year 2017, you were randomly selected to participate in the Survey of Doctorate Recipients. The most recent
								doctorate recipients listed in the DRF are added to the overall SDR sample every time the survey is conducted

								About  124,000 out of 1.1 million (approximately 11.0%) science, engineering and health doctorate holders have

								agricultural, and environmental life sciences, computer and information sciences, mathematics and statistics,
								the physical sciences, psychology, the social sciences, engineering, and health. It samples individuals who

								The National Science Foundation publishes SDR results and data in two notable report series: Characteristics of

								Because the SDR is a panel study--a study of a group of individuals over a number of years--it is critical for

								The study includes people in a variety of employment situations. Learning that you've retired--whether you've
								retired but have since returned to work part time or full time, or whether you've stopped working entirely--is
								important information that makes SDR trend data more complete and more useful. The National Science Foundation
								is especially interested in how the career paths of retirees may change over time and in the current
								economy--an economy in which some retirees need to return to work, perhaps in fields that are very different
								from the fields of their doctoral degrees, and in which some workers may retire either earlier or later than
								planned. The only way to track such career changes and trends is to include all respondents in the study, even
								those retired individuals who intend to stay retired. Your participation can help to ensure that our
